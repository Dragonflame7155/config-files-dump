# bash - Add the following to your ~/.bashrc 
source <(kitty + complete setup bash) 

#Older versions of bash (for example, v3.2) do not support process substitution with the source #command, in which #case you can try an alternative: 
source /dev/stdin <<<"$(kitty + complete setup bash)" 

# zsh - Add the following to your ~/.zshrc 
autoload -Uz compinit 

compinit 
# Completion for kitty 
kitty + complete setup zsh | source /dev/stdin 

#The important thing above is to make sure the call to kitty to load the zsh completions happens after the call to compinit. 

#fish 
#For versions of fish earlier than 3.0.0, add the following to your ~/.config/fish/config.fish. Later versions source completions by default.
